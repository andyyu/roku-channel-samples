This channel is designed to test the performance of a RowList after loading in a variable amount of unique images (with the addition of a background video playing).

Notice that the difference between choosing ten images per row and hundreds of images per row shows only delays in load time and no further performance degradation once the content has been loaded. Also notice that once the video has been loaded, it results in no further performance issue while it is playing.
